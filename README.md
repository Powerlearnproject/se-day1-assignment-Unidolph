#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineeringis the systematic applications of engineering principles to develope and maintain high quality software systems.
The software applications and systems developed power various modern life aspects like communication , commerce , entertainment and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages by Portan
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
3. The rise of Agile Methodologies in 2000s that helped in solving some software development challenges

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - writing codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets the qualitu standards and functionality requirements.
5. Development - release the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance - provide ongoing support , updates , enhancements on the software after development.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall uses sequential approach with distinct phases and mostly appropriate for a well defined requirements and strict deadline projects while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to changes and is most preferable with dynamic environment and continuous improvement initiative projects

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - Write codes and implement software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager - oversees the planning , execution and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provode comprehensive tools for writing , debugging and testing codes eg visual studio.
VCS helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements- this occurs during development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays , can be solved by using agile methodologies and effective communication.
2. Tight deadlines- prressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality, can be solved by prioritization of tasks.
3. Technical Debt - occure from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions , technical debt can impede future development and increase maintenance costs , can be solved by regular reassessment of project goals and timelines and quality control.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - is testing individual components or modules of a software.
2. Integration testing - is testing the enrire software system as a whole.
3. Acceptance testing - is the testing of the software against the user requirements ro ensure it meets all user needs.
They help in identification and fixation of defects in the development process leading to higher quality of software products. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of crafting precise prompts to help generative AI models correctly respond to questions and perform a wide range of tasks.
It improves the AI model's ability to produce accurate and relevant responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- 'I need a book to read'
Improved prompt- 'I need a science fiction novel with a strong male lead'
The first prompt is open-ended and will give any kind of book recommendation while the second prompt is precise and specific and will give recommendation for the user's specific interest.
